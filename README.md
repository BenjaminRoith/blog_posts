Since arriving on the digital art scene in late 2015, London-born artist Thomas Hedger has swiftly garnered a significant following not only amongst public audiences, but also across critical spheres. Demonstrating a signature penchant for bold colours, and the striking contrasts which naturally arise through the created juxtapositions, Hedger evokes a sense of audacious simplicity – simplicity which is unapologetically cartoonish yet also surreally seductive. A sense of simplicity which appears immediate yet remains somehow elusive in a manner which provocatively recalls the tongue-in-cheek character central to Warhol's craft. Health, both mental and physical, represents an important thematic pillar of Hedger’s subject matter, and both Yogactivities and May Contain are fueled by an artistic impulse towards improvements in health. 


### Yogactivities (2016)

Yogactivities, first released on 8th April 2016, is described by the artist himself as “Activity sheets designed to promote meditation and learning through drawing and other activities”. Despite his use of non-realistic forms, the piece retains an essential form of visual clarity through Hedger’s use of bold lines and vibrant colours. Rooted in geometry, Hedger successfully evokes a fitting sense of balance – exactly the kind of natural, healthy balance one strives to attain through the practice of yoga. In conjunction, the manner in which Hedger situates the standing figures diagonally, and the triangular and circular prostrate figures similarly diagonally, imbues the piece with a further sense of balanced symmetry.

### May Contain

Hedger released May Contain on 25th May 2018 as a promotional video to acclaim. Working with the British EpiPen manufacturer May Contain in the hope of encouraging greater EpiPen awareness across the nation, Hedger not only successfully conveys a sense of effective dynamism through his inclusion of blue direction arrows, but also exhibits his artistic willingness to play with the medical seriousness of his subject matter through presenting the created image of a naked female derriere, which is shiny to a cartoonish degree. Educational, sexy, and direct – it is perhaps unsurprising that Hedger has gained a reputation as one of the cheekiest digital artists around.

# Blog Post II - 'Hello World' Reflection
------

As an English major who has perennially found himself at various battling odds with phones, computers, or, indeed, any mode of technology, I am the first to admit that I struggled immensely with the coding elements of my ‘Hello World’ sketch. I cannot claim to boast any background in computer science, and this opening project, therefore, represented my very first foray into the realm of coding – an overwhelmingly frustrating first foray I must confess. However, once I actually began to move things around successfully, my satisfaction was firmly undeniable. Although the piece may appear distinctly eclectic, I feel like I was ultimately able to capture the primary thematic elements which fueled the artistic endeavour: the frustration I felt throughout the process capitulated as an apocalyptic maelstrom on a global scale; and bizarre representations of some kind of abstruse, and absurdist, theological salvation. Inspired by a Chinese folk vision of the apocalypse, the eleven snow leopards represent the harbingers of the end of days in a manner parallel to the Four Horsemen of the Biblical tradition. The tale warns of a day when these eleven snow leopards would descend from the Tien-Shan Mountains, and gallop across the Earth’s equator, scorching everything in their path. Yet, I encountered the obstinate coding obstacle of imbuing the snow leopards with motion – an obstacle which, I am ashamed to confess, ultimately proved insurmountable. Looking forward, I hope to be able to include various forms of motion in my pieces, contributing a sense of dynamism which I believe, at least, proves crucial to the artistry underlying digital art. For someone as technologically challenged as I, it is a game of small steps – the first of which, logically, rests in learning to master linear motion. In conjunction, my ‘Hello World’ sketch also lacks an interactive element which I will also strive to remedy in future works. Ultimately, I enjoyed this project, at least once I started making progress, and it definitely hauled me out of my academic comfort zone, and although I’m relatively happy with the final product, it is unequivocal that there remains much progress to be made in the weeks to come.
