Since arriving on the digital art scene in late 2015, London-born artist Thomas Hedger has swiftly garnered a significant following not only amongst public audiences, but also across critical spheres. Demonstrating a signature penchant for bold colours, and the striking contrasts which naturally arise through the created juxtapositions, Hedger evokes a sense of audacious simplicity – simplicity which is unapologetically cartoonish yet also surreally seductive. A sense of simplicity which appears immediate yet remains somehow elusive in a manner which provocatively recalls the tongue-in-cheek character central to Warhol's craft. Health, both mental and physical, represents an important thematic pillar of Hedger’s subject matter, and both Yogactivities and May Contain are fueled by an artistic impulse towards improvements in health. 


### 'Yogactivities' - Thomas Hedger (2016)

'Yogactivities', first released on 8th April 2016, is described by the artist himself as “Activity sheets designed to promote meditation and learning through drawing and other activities”. Despite his use of non-realistic forms, the piece retains an essential form of visual clarity through Hedger’s use of bold lines and vibrant colours. Rooted in geometry, Hedger successfully evokes a fitting sense of balance – exactly the kind of natural, healthy balance one strives to attain through the practice of yoga. In conjunction, the manner in which Hedger situates the standing figures diagonally, and the triangular and circular prostrate figures similarly diagonally, imbues the piece with a further sense of balanced symmetry.

### 'May Contain' - Thomas Hedger (2018)

Hedger released 'May Contain' on 25th May 2018 as a promotional video to acclaim. Working with the British EpiPen manufacturer May Contain in the hope of encouraging greater EpiPen awareness across the nation, Hedger not only successfully conveys a sense of effective dynamism through his inclusion of blue direction arrows, but also exhibits his artistic willingness to play with the medical seriousness of his subject matter through presenting the created image of a naked female derriere, which is shiny to a cartoonish degree. Educational, sexy, and direct – it is perhaps unsurprising that Hedger has gained a reputation as one of the cheekiest digital artists around.

# Blog Post II - 'Hello World' Reflection
------

As an English major who has perennially found himself at various battling odds with phones, computers, or, indeed, any mode of technology, I am the first to admit that I struggled immensely with the coding elements of my ‘Hello World’ sketch. I cannot claim to boast any background in computer science, and this opening project, therefore, represented my very first foray into the realm of coding – an overwhelmingly frustrating first foray I must confess. However, once I actually began to move things around successfully, my satisfaction was firmly undeniable. Although the piece may appear distinctly eclectic, I feel like I was ultimately able to capture the primary thematic elements which fueled the artistic endeavour: the frustration I felt throughout the process capitulated as an apocalyptic maelstrom on a global scale; and bizarre representations of some kind of abstruse, and absurdist, theological salvation. Inspired by a Chinese folk vision of the apocalypse, the eleven snow leopards represent the harbingers of the end of days in a manner parallel to the Four Horsemen of the Biblical tradition. The tale warns of a day when these eleven snow leopards would descend from the Tien-Shan Mountains, and gallop across the Earth’s equator, scorching everything in their path. Yet, I encountered the obstinate coding obstacle of imbuing the snow leopards with motion – an obstacle which, I am ashamed to confess, ultimately proved insurmountable. Looking forward, I hope to be able to include various forms of motion in my pieces, contributing a sense of dynamism which I believe, at least, proves crucial to the artistry underlying digital art. For someone as technologically challenged as I, it is a game of small steps – the first of which, logically, rests in learning to master linear motion. In conjunction, my ‘Hello World’ sketch also lacks an interactive element which I will also strive to remedy in future works. Ultimately, I enjoyed this project, at least once I started making progress, and it definitely hauled me out of my academic comfort zone, and although I’m relatively happy with the final product, it is unequivocal that there remains much progress to be made in the weeks to come.

# Blog Post III - Chance Operations and Creative Output
------

### 'Fontana Mix (Orange/Tan)' - John Cage (1981)
![John Cage](images/Cage.png?raw=true "John Cage")

In addition to his illustrious career as a composer and musical theorist of global repute, John Cage (1912 – 1992) has also received wide critical acclaim for his works of visual art. Drawing upon an eclectic variety of intellectual influences including the philosophical beliefs of Zen Buddhism and Indian folk traditions, as well as the aesthetic principles of the contemporaneous Dada and Surrealist movements, Cage’s craft is fueled by the idea of artistic indeterminacy – indeterminacy evoked through a reliance upon chance operations. Like the cadavre exquis – a curious collaborative art form popular amongst the Surrealists which entailed each artist’s blind contribution to a larger unseen piece – Cage’s artistic mission rests in an attempt to remove to remove his own intention from the piece itself. To allow the piece to generate itself according to its own organically indeterminate impulses: to breathe life into a piece and witness it mould and reformulate itself according to such rhythms. Cage characterized his craft thus: “I use chance operations instead of operating according to my likes and dislikes”; and 'Fontana Mix (Orange/Tan)' certainly represents a stunning testament to the chaotic, random, and strikingly natural beauty of Cage’s craft, both musical and visual.

### 'Drawing' - Harold Cohen (1974)
![Harold Cohen](images/Cohen.png?raw=true "Harold Cohen")

Credited as the creator of AARON – a computer program which creates art autonomously – it is perhaps unsurprising that Harold Cohen (1928 – 2016) is often regarded as a pivotal figure situated at the burgeoning intersection between art and artificial intelligence. Despite receiving a traditional education in painting in his youth, Cohen later found himself drawn towards the field of computer programming, fueling his artistic impulse to reconcile the two seemingly disparate disciplines. His rather ignominiously titled 1974 piece constitutes a scattered, random array of initially black-and-white shapes entirely generated through the chance operations run by the computer, which then receive a subsequent hand-colouring treatment by the artist following their production. Like Cage, Cohen seeks to diminish his own creative control by bestowing complete generative control to the work itself. However, the fact that Cohen hand-colours the generated shapes ultimately reinstalls a degree of artistic agency – herein rests the delicate balance between artificial intelligence and art, between chance and creative control.

# Blog Post IV - Control and Algorithmic Expression Reflection
------

The late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries witnessed a profusion of avant-garde movements blossom across the global artistic landscape, including the Fauvist, Futurist, and Dada movements. However, Surrealism is often lauded as the most pervasive and revolutionary of these various artistic movements. Philosophically indebted to latent Freudian influences, the Surrealists strove to liberate the artist from the shackles of the rational in the hope of achieving a more organic, truer form of artistic expression – artistic expression untainted by the restrictive qualities of conscious rationality. Control could only prove constraining to the surrealists. The rise to prominence of the cadavre exquis provides a powerful testament to the lengths to which the surrealists journeyed in the hope of fulfilling their ambition. A cadavre exquis is guided by two primary ideals: collaboration, and the artist’s utter lack of control as he blindly contributes to the greater totality of a work without witnessing the contributions of the other artists involved in the piece. For example, the seminal 1927 work 'Nude' (included below) represents a collaborative endeavour shared between the influential artistic quartet of Joan Miro, Max Morise, Man Ray, and Yves Tanguy, and has become engrained within the fabric of not only the surrealist canon, but also of the wider avant-garde canon itself. Owing to my deep-rooted interest in Surrealism, the question of artistic control in relation to the creation of organic art presents itself as thoroughly intriguing to me, and I was eager to explore which unforeseeable avenues the implementation of such principles would lead my work. In particular, I was fascinated with the idea of a piece’s self-emergence through algorithmic expression, and I sought to achieve the effect of a minimalist piece which could emerge, from essential nothingness, through its own digital rhythms yet still prove malleable to the user through such elements as his ability to adjust and manipulate both the speed of the so-called ‘jail-bars’, and the direction in which they move vertically across the screen. Ultimately, these parameters successfully enabled me to maintain a degree of aesthetic control and rigidity over the work, and, as a result, it failed to ever arrive at a stage of algorithmic entropy where I felt like the piece had transformed beyond its intended aesthetics – aesthetics which were rooted within the ideal of achieving a vaguely controllable chaos.
